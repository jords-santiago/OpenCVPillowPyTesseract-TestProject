# OpenCVPillowPyTesseract-TestProject
This is a project derived from one of the assignment I made on the Python 3 Programming Specialization from Coursera.

This applies the use of Pillow, OpenCV, and Pytesseract to extract faces and text from images.

The test images were from the PNG files provided by Vaibhav Bria (https://www.kaggle.com/immvab/document-object-detection).  Those were then placed to a ZIP file to save space in processing. 

The image data, faces and text will be stored to a dictionary.
